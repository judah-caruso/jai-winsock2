# Winsock 2

Winsock 2 bindings for the Jai language.

# Usage

This depends on the static version of my [C interop module](https://github.com/judah-caruso/C) (already included).

```shell
# Manual management
mkdir vendor && cd vendor/
git clone https://github.com/judah-caruso/jai-winsock2 Winsock
```
